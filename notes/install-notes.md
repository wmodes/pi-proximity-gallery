# Install Notes

Write raspian image to sd card from MacOS

    $ diskutil list
    $ diskutil unmount /dev/disk1s1
    $ unzip -p 2017-11-29-raspbian-stretch.zip | sudo dd of=/dev/disk1 bs=1m
    
Boot to brand new raspian

Authorize to local wifi

Enable ssh

Rename host to prox1. This gives us the ability to ssh to prox1.local. (avahi does this, and it's on by default on Raspbian)
